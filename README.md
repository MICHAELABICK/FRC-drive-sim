# FRC-drive-sim
MatLab scripts to simulate a friction limited, current limited, differential drive

* Test is a script to plot the speed vs torque curve of a friction limited, current limited motor
* Test2 is a script to plot the position, velocity, and acceleration curves of a drivetrain in a straight line
* IN PROGRESS: Test3 is a script to plot the path, max velocity, and actual kinematics curves of a differential drivetrain
